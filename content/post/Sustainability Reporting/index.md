Sustainability reporting, in the business world, refers to the disclosure of non-financial performance data to external parties of the organization, whether voluntarily, upon request, or as a requirement. The capacity to reduce risk throughout an organization's supply chain is made possible by sustainability reporting's contribution to more effective decision-making processes.

The benifiets of sustainability reporting are:
- The justification of business behaviour and the promotion of goods and services with positive social and environmental effects.Increase in corporate reputation and brand value
- Developing a competitive edge
- Demonstrating greater competitiveness by using sustainability reporting activities as a stand-in for overall performance
- Comparison and benchmarking against competitors
- Increasing honesty and responsibility within the organization
- Creating and sustaining staff motivation, as well as internal information and control procedures

Reporting is done for a variety of purposes. First and foremost, reporting on sustainability helps make it easier to monitor progress toward predetermined goals. The implementation of the environmental strategy is then made easier as a result of the previous action. It raises awareness of general environmental challenges within the organisation. Sustainability reporting has the power to effectively communicate the corporate message both internally and internationally. Additionally, it increased overall credibility due to more transparency. It has the capability of communicating norms and efforts. It enables campaigning and operating. Finally, it provides benefits for reputation, cost savings identification, higher effectiveness, improved company development opportunities, and improved staff morale.
