Ecotourism is ethical travel to natural regions that preserves the environment, supports the welfare of the local community, and includes interpretation and education. Outdoor recreation, such as hiking, skiing, and camping, is a new culture nowadays. Additionally, the physical activity and health value that result from outdoor recreation can be considered important benefits of forests. Not only is there evidence that nature improves physical well-being, but it can benefit humans both psychologically and spiritually. It has been noted that many individuals consider ‚Äúthe forest‚Äù as a ‚Äúsymbolic and self-directed entity without referring to a specific place‚Äù.This emphasizes the emotional and spiritual connection humans have with forests and their importance to their well-being. Tourists visit forests for both physical and mental experiences. Therefore, it is very important to think about ecotourism and how to make it more sustainable.

Ecotourism is a significant economic and educational endeavor when done properly. It has the potential to connect to a larger audience and foster conservation support while educating the general public about the value and fragility of such ecosystems. Additionally, it encourages the non-consumptive use of wilderness areas for the benefit of nearby populations that rely on these delicate environments. It entails traveling to scenic locations, which offers respite from the stressful artificial world and a momentary reprieve from the pollution of big cities. When individuals personally engage with nature, it inspires a feeling of their conservation on a personal level and fosters environmental consciousness among the tourists. It draws attention to regional and tribal traditions and fosters respect for these lesser-known cultures. Ecotourism creates jobs, offers financial help, and strengthens the local community. Ecotourism opens up a lot of chances for a developing nation in terms of environmental challenges, empowering indigenous tribes, producing jobs, and sustainable development.
