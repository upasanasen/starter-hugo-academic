Greenpeace has been actively campaigning against plastic pollution for many years. Here are some of the actions they have taken to fight against plastic pollution:


 Plastic-free initiatives: Greenpeace has launched various campaigns to reduce plastic waste. One of the notable campaigns is their "Plastic-free Campus" initiative, which aims to make universities and colleges plastic-free.


 Pressure on corporations: Greenpeace has put pressure on corporations to reduce their plastic use. In 2019, they launched a campaign against Coca-Cola, calling on the company to reduce its plastic footprint. As a result of the campaign, Coca-Cola committed to collecting and recycling the equivalent of every bottle or can they sell by 2030.


 Promoting alternative solutions: Greenpeace has been advocating for alternative solutions to plastic, such as reusable bags, bottles, and containers. They have also been calling for a shift towards a circular economy, where products are designed to be reused and recycled.

 
 Raising awareness: Greenpeace has been raising awareness about the impacts of plastic pollution on the environment and human health. They have produced reports, videos, and other materials to educate the public about the issue.


 Direct action: Greenpeace has taken direct action to highlight the issue of plastic pollution. In 2018, they launched a campaign called "The Last Straw" where they placed a giant plastic straw sculpture outside the UK Parliament to draw attention to the issue.


These are just a few examples of what Greenpeace has done to fight against plastic pollution. The organization is committed to promoting sustainable solutions and protecting the planet for future generations.
