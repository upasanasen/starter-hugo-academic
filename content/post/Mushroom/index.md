Researchers at a biotechnology company in California, USA, discovered a ground-breaking material that will help inreducing animal cruelty. Mycelium, a component that resembles a thread, makes up a portion of the fungus's body. According to experts, this `mycelium leather` will be significantly more durable than regular leather. Additionally, any
shape can be selected while creating this skin, eliminating waste when using it.
Additionally, according to researchers, this leather will lessen the need for plastic and synthetic fibres in the future. As a result, the planet will be spared from the environmental damage that plastic does. Air pollution is another adverse effect of the leather business. It. Will help use to avail vegan-friendly material and reduce air pollution.
Although this invention has a lot of potential, there are some issues with it. Economically speaking, it is incredibly expensive to produce this fungus leather. As a result, only a few exclusive and pricey fashion companies can afford it. Anyways, there is currently no mass production system. Scientists are hopeful that these issues can be resolved swiftly with the help of advance scientific approach. Overall, this discovery is genuinely groundbreaking, but it won't be clear until later how well its direct applications will work.
