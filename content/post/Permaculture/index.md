According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2019 report, a third of all greenhouse gas emissions are attributed to the world's food production systems, which include agriculture, forestry, livestock, and other land uses. These systems produce 13% carbon dioxide, 44% methane, and 82% nitrous oxide emissions. We cannot expect agriculture to stay resilient, and as a result, the farming system urgently needs to reform. At this point, a different farming method known as "Permaculture" was developed in the 1970s by Australian biologist Bill Mollison and his student David Holmgren.

The goal of permaculture is to create long-lasting productive systems and sustainable communities that reduce the use of non-renewable energy and regulate ecological cycles. `Earth care`, `people care`, and a `fair share` are the three pillars of permaculture. It requires a methodical strategy based on the local environment to ensure that any systemic changes have no negative effects on the planet or its inhabitants.

To adopt permaculture, we have to understand the type of the landscape, the way the water flows, the animals and trees there, and the state of the land are all made clear to us by this. It includes planning for infrastructure, a master plan, and where housing communities are located and how vegetation is grown. Methods used for this include topographical research, sound mapping, bird and tree counts, hydrological surveys, etc. 

The practice of permaculture has its own special obstacles, just like any other agricultural method. Large landscapes, for example, may have different outcomes in various locations depending on how well the ecosystem is maintained there. Additionally, there is a need to motivate farmers to abandon chemical use in favor of soil conservation and restoration. Therefore, the largest issue is to comprehend and enhance the environment before deciding on food production.
