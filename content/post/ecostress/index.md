Fear of ecological calamity or environmental harm is known as eco-anxiety. The environment and climate change's present and projected future states are the basis for this fear. Instead of ignoring your emotions, try to accept them as fully valid and vital.

Some steps to reduce eco-anxiety:
* Firstly, acknowledge your concerns about climate change 
* Expand your knowledge related to climate crisis mitigation strategies by reading books, articles, newspapers, social media, and blogs.
* Interact with people and share your experience with folks who understand your concerns.
* Take action such as eating less meat, reducing water wastage, reducing food wastage, being mindful while using natural resources, and conserving energy. 
* Finally, creating awareness in the community.
