A geographical indicator (GI) is a label placed on goods that come from a certain area and have characteristics or a reputation that are specific to that area of origin. A sign must specify that a product is from a specific location in order for it to serve as a GI. Furthermore, the origin of the product should be largely responsible for its attributes, traits, or reputation. There is an obvious connection between the product and its original site of production because the attributes are dependent on the geographic location of production. A geographical indicator right permits the owner of the right to use the indication to stop a third party from using it to market a product that doesn't meet the relevant criteria. A protected geographical indication's possessor is not able to stop others from producing goods using the same methods as those specified in the indication's standards, nevertheless. Agriculture, handicrafts, food, wine & spirits, and industrial products are among the common categories for which geographic indications are utilised. In general, geographical indications are protected in various national and regional systems utilising a wide range of strategies, frequently combining two or more of the strategies (1. sui generis systems (i.e. special regimes of protection); 2. using collective or certification marks; and 3. methods focusing on business practices, including administrative product approval schemes). These strategies were created while taking into account various legal traditions as well as the unique historical and economic circumstances of each individual.
