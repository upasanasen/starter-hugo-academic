CDP, formerly known as Carbon Disclosure Project, is a global environmental impact non-profit organization. An international non-profit organization based in the United Kingdom, Japan, India, China, Germany, and the United States of America. It has local partners across 50 countries. CDP started with the primary focus on GHG emissions and has now grown to water and forest-related issues.  It has grown to 8400 companies responding to climate change, forest, and water security questionnaires. 
CDP data is extensively used by academics, businesses, Finance, and other communities in many aspects. CDP data is used to rate products and rate them. It is helpful for investors and is used to assess the carbon footprint. Also, 95% of large purchasing organizations use the data for their procurement processes. It is used to assess a company's performance and as part of supplier evaluation and performance review. 
Many groups and communities use CDP data. A 2019 survey by CDP shows that  75% of responding companies say reporting to CDP improves their reputation. The same reporting to CDP has their organization to be more competitive. CDP scoring methodology guides the companies on a journey through disclosures to awareness management and finally to leadership.  More than 200 companies have been recognized on the CDP list for climate change, forest, and water security in 2019, and ‚ÄúA list‚Äù is used in the STOXX low carbon Indices and the Euronext index licensed to Goldman Sachs.
